# 6.12:  Looping through:  dict of lists.

# Loop through each key in the dict and print the key and
# associated value (a list) (you can use a comma to separate
# the key and value).  Then instead of printing each list with
# the key, print the sum of each list.  Use 'for' with dict
# subscript.

dol = { 'a': [1, 2, 3],
        'b': [10, 20, 30],
        'c': [100, 200, 300] }


# Expected Output:

# a 6
# b 60
# c 600
