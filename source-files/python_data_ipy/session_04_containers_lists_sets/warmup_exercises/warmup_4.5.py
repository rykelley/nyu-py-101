# 4.5:  Extending the previous program, use len() to determine
# the length of the list, then use the formula sum(flist) /
# len(flist) to produce an average (where flist is the list of
# floats you compiled).



# Expected Output:

# 94.5728571429
# 
# # your floating point remainder may be slightly different
