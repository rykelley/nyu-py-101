# 4.1:  Create an empty list.  Opening and looping through the
# file student_db.txt, split each line into elements, and
# append just the state values (the 4th value in each row) to
# a list.  Print the list object.  (Hint:  make sure the list
# is initialized before the loop begins and is printed after
# the loop ends.  If either statement is found inside the
# loop, it will be executed multiple times.



# Expected Output:

# ['state', 'NY', 'NY', 'NY', 'PA', 'NY', 'NJ', 'NJ']
