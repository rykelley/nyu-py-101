# 4.8:  Given the following code:

values = [30, 20, 10, 40, 50, 60]

# Determine the median value, which in an even-number of
# elements is halfway between the two "middle" values in a
# sorted list.  (Hint:  again use the len() of the list to
# calculate the indices of the middle two values.)

# Expected Output:

# 35
