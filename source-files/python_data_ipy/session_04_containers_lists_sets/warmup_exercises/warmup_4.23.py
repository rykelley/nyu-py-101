# 4.23:  Start with the following code:

text = "we're certainly out of gouda but Python is great."

# Now split this text into words (no need to strip or
# lowercase).  Removing the printing of the set and adding to
# the end of the code, loop through each word in text and
# check the word against the set created earlier (use the in
# operator to check for membership).  If the word is not in
# the set, print it.

# Expected Output:

# certainly
# but
# Python
# is
# great.
