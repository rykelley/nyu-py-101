# 4.18:  Extending the previous code, use a single call to
# .rstrip() to remove any punctuation.  (Hint:  you can place
# any punctuation characters to be removed together in a
# single string argument to rstrip(); any single character
# within the string will be removed.)



# Expected Output:

# I
# could
# I
# wouldn't
# I
# might
# Might
# I
