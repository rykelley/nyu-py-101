# 4.15:  Opening the revenue.csv text file, loop through and
# print each line of the file, but make sure there are no
# blank lines printed (hint:  use rstrip() on each line to
# remove the newline character; print() itself already prints
# a newline at the end of every line).

# Expected Output:

# Haddad's,PA,239.50
# Westfield,NJ,53.90
# The Store,NJ,211.50
# Hipster's,NY,11.98
# Dothraki Fashions,NY,5.98
# Awful's,PA,23.95
# The Clothiers,NY,115.20
