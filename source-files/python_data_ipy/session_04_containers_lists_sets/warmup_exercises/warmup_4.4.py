# 4.4:  Opening and reading through revenue.csv, build a list
# from the 3rd field (the floating point value), then sum up
# the values using sum().  (Hint:  sum() will not work unless
# you convert each element to a float value before you add it
# to the list, so do that by calling float() on each item.)



# Expected Output:

# 662.01
# 
# # may have a tiny remainder, i.e., 662.0100000000001
