# 4.14:  Given a list containing duplicate values, initialize
# an empty set() (note that you cannot use empty braces
# because these are reserved for dicts -- use set()) and add
# each element to it to produce a set of unique values.  Print
# the whole set.  (Note:  just for practice, don't pass the
# list directly to the set() constructor -- loop through the
# list and add each element one at a time.)

dupvals = [1, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3]

# Expected Output:

# {1, 2, 3}
