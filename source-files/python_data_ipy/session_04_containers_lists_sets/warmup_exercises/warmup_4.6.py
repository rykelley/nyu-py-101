# 4.6:  Given the following code:

values = [1, 3, 4, 10, 15]

# Determine and print the median (middle) value without
# mentioning any values directly.  (Hint:  use len() to
# determine the length, then use that value to figure out the
# "halfway" index.  Make sure your calculated index is an
# integer).

# Expected Output:

# 4
