# 4.2:  Extend the previous program by omitting the first line
# from the file.  One way to do this is to call line =
# next(fh) on the file handle (assuming this is the variable
# name you used for the filehandle).  This should be done
# before the loop begins, and will advance the file pointer to
# the next line.



# Expected Output:

# ['NY', 'NY', 'NY', 'PA', 'NY', 'NJ', 'NJ']
