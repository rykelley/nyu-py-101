# 8.13:  Build a filepath.

# Given the below directory name and filename, build a
# complete filepath.  Use os.path.join()

dirname = '../warmup_exercises/'

filename = 'warmup_1.1.py'


# Note that on Windows computers, os.path.join() will insert a
# backslash instead of a forward slash.  This completed path
# is still valid.

# Expected Output:

# ../warmup_exercises/challenge_1.1.py
