# 8.33:  Append to an existing file.

# Open the file you created previously for appending (using
# the 'a' argument instead of 'w') and write one or more
# additional lines to it.  Again, add the newline character to
# each line.  After running the program/cell, open the file
# and look at it to see it has been written to (make sure to
# call .close() on the file or you may not see the written
# text.)
