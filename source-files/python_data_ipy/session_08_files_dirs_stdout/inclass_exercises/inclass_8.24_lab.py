# 8.24:  List a directory and show full path to each file.

# Starting with the below directory, list the directory's
# contents, joining each entry to the directory name so it
# becomes a full path to the directory.

import runreport

dirname = '../testdir'



# Expected Output:

# ../testdir/file2.txt
# ../testdir/file3.txt
# ../testdir/file1.txt
# ../testdir/testdir3
# ../testdir/testdir2

# Note the above results may be in a different order on your
# system.  Also, you may see additional entries .DS_Store,
# .Trashes or other "hidden" files starting with a period.
