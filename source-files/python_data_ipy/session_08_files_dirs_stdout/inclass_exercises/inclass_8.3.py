# 8.3:  Write a function with one argument and two return
# values.

# Define function 'double_and_halve' that takes one numeric
# argument, and returns the value doubled as well as halved.
# Note:  you must not use 'a' or 'b' inside the function, and
# you must not print inside the function - values must be
# returned

# your function def here

a = 50

d, h = double_and_halve(a)

print(d)                # 100
print(h)                # 25.0

# Expected Output:

# 100
# 25.0
