# 8.32:  Write lines to a file, including newlines.

# Open a file for writing (using a new filename) and write 3
# lines to it (they can be as simple as 'line1', 'line2' and
# 'line3'.  Add the newline character to each line.  After
# running the program/cell, open the file and look at it to
# see it has been written to (make sure to call .close() on
# the file or you may not see the written text.)
