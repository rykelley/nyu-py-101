# 8.5:  Write a function with two arguments and one return
# value.

# Define function get_diff() that takes two numeric arguments
# and returns the difference between the two.  Note:  you must
# not use 'x' or 'y' inside the function, and you must not
# print inside the function - value must be returned.

import runreport

# your function def here

x = 50
y = 10

z = get_diff(x, y)         # int, 40
print(z)                   # 40
