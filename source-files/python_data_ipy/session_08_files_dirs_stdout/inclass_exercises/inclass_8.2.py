# 8.2:  Write a function with one argument and one return
# value.

# Define function 'get_half' that takes one argument, divides
# the value by two, and returns the halved value.  Note:  you
# must not use 'a' or 'b' inside the function, and you must
# not print inside the function -- value must be returned.

# your function code here

a = 5
x = get_half(a)
print(x)           # 2.5

b = 100
y = get_half(b)
print(y)           # 50.0

# Expected Output:

# 2.5
# 50.0
