# 8.3:  os.path.getsize().  Pick a file in the python_data
# directory (or any file) and save the path to the file in a
# string variable, like so:

filename = 'student_db.txt'   # this is the name of an existing file

# Write a script that prints the size of the file in bytes.

# Expected output (will vary depending on file chosen):

# student_db.txt:   333 bytes
