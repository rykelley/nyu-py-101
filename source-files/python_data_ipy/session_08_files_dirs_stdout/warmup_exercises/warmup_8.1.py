# 8.1:  Allow your Program to Accept Arguments.  Accept two
# arguments at the command line, using the default list object
# sys.argv, a list that is automatically available after you
# execute the statement import sys.  Sum the values and print
# out a formatted string with an "addition" formula.  (As
# mentioned in the slides, the first argument is at
# sys.argv[1], the second at sys.argv[2], etc.)

# Expected Output:

# $ python myprog.py 5 19
# 5 + 19 = 24
# 
# $ python myprog.py 100 4
# 100 + 4 = 104
