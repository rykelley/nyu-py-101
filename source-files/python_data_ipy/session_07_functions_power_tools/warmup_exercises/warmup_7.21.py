# 7.21:  Open ../student_db.txt.  Use a list comprehension to
# open the file and load it into a list as we did in previous
# exercises.  Print the resulting list.  (Hint:  a list
# comprehension loops through any iterable (object that can be
# looped or iterated through), so you can place the call to
# open() right in the list comprehension and it will loop over
# that (or rather, the file object returned from it.)



# Expected Output:

# ['id:address:city:state:zip\n',
#  'jk43:23 Marfield Lane:Plainview:NY:10023\n',
#  'ZXE99:315 W. 115th Street, Apt. 11B:New York:NY:10027\n',
#  'jab44:23 Rivington Street, Apt. 3R:New York:NY:10002\n',
#  'ak9:234 Main Street:Philadelphia:PA:08990\n',
#  'ap172:19 Boxer Rd.:New York:NY:10005\n',
