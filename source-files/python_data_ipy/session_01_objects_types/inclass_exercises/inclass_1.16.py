# 1.16:  input(), print() and sys.exit() functions.

# Take user input with input().  Print the result and its
# type.  Then call sys.exit() to signal an exit.

import sys




# Note that in Jupyter Notebook, the notebook will not exit,
# but will show that sys.exit() has been called.  sys.exit()
# is more appropriate for standalone programs.
