\f0\fs24 \cf0 As I start my homework, I will recall the following rules:\
\
1. Before using a feature (statement, function or method), I review it\'92s usage and syntax at pythonreferance.com\
\
2. After using a feature, I confirm the resulting object type and value, noting this in a Type/Value Notation places to the right of each line ( see homework instructions) \
\
3. Whenever I see an exception (error), I look up the type (SyntaxError, ValueError, etc. at pythonreference.com ) and the code line noted in the error, and do my best to understand what Python is trying to tell me. Then I attempt to respond to the error -- I try not to take general guesses about what may be wrong.}
